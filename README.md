Role-Based User Authentication System
The project is a role-based user authentication system integrated into a Spring MVC application. It aims to secure web resources and manage user access based on their roles, such as "USER" or "ADMIN." 
Using Spring Security and database authentication, the system authenticates users and grants access to different parts of the application depending on their roles.
